## What are the four key benefits of DevOps and how can we utilise them (provide use cases or examples)

## What is public cloud, Hybrid cloud and private cloud (use cases)
- Public cloud consits of services and resources made publically available by the provider. These allow resources and responsibilities to be transferred offsite.
- Private cloud consists of on premises infrastructure and cloud specifically for one organisation. This allows greater control of the system, which is especiially useful when handling data subject to regulations and laws. Private clouds also have lower latency than public clouds
- Hybrid cloud utilises a mixture of both public and private cloud. This allows organisations to reap all the benefits of public cloud such as removing load off local resources, whilst taking advantage of the control the private cloud gives for sensitive assets. Resources can also be migrated between the two easily and more gradually than starting from scratch.
